# Failure-Prediction-of-Components-in-Air-Pressure-System
In this project, I've used different ML techniques to obtain confusion matrix and cost of the system in different conditions. 
The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus on the “Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes.”
